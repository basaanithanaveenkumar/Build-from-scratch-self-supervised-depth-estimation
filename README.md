# Build-from-scratch-self-supervised-depth-estimation
This repository provides a complete, from-scratch implementation of a self-supervised depth estimation framework designed to predict depth maps from monocular images without relying on explicit ground-truth depth supervision.



# TODO
1. Create a good readme and usage of uv
2. write good doc file
3. integrate UV
4. do a literature search on loss functions for self-supervised depth estimation (they are the core)
